# RecreatedOITQ
This is an attempt at recreating Mineplex's gamemode "One in the Quiver" to the best of my ability.
This project will not serve to be a 1-to-1 replica of the gamemode, but rather a recreation simple enough for someone to load on their server and play with some friends.

## I want to help!
Please wait until the core gamemode functionality is complete (milestone)
Afterwards, you can take on one of the open issues to help.

## A note about plugin compatibility
Note that this plugin is not intended to work with other plugins that handle player combat and/or death/respawn events, etc...
It is intended to be played on a Spigot 1.19.4 server with no other plugins.
Other plugins used alongside this plugin will result in your issues being invalid. Please report issues once you're sure they don't result from other plugins.
